# Project Just Tawk

This project is a React application that aims to replicate the Just Tawk website (https://justtawk.com/).

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `src/components/home`: Contains components specific to the home page.
- `src/pages`: Contains the main page components for each route.
- `src/assets`: Contains static assets like images and fonts.
- `src/context`: Contains React context providers.
- `src/data`: Contains static data like JSON files.
- `src/routes`: Contains the routing configuration.
- `src/css`: Contains CSS files.

## Conventions

- **Styling**: We use Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom styles and theme configuration are defined in `src/index.css`.
- **Components**: Components should be small, reusable, and have a single responsibility.
- **File Naming**: Components should be named in PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent.jsx`). Pages should also be in PascalCase.
- **Commits**: Follow conventional commit message standards.
